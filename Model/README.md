# LocVent

## locust Identification
<p>
<br>The first step is the identification of locust from the ohter grasshopers. Deep learning is used to detect grasshopper</br> 
<br>types that are dangerous or that can become swarms when get the right conditions. The image sent from the user is </br>
<br>feed to a deep learning model. The model classifies the image if it is a dangerous or normal types of grasshoper.<br>
 
</p>

## Vegetation Status Classification 
<p>
<br>In this phase the vegition index found from a satellite imagery is used to classify the vegetation status of a given area.</br>
<br>If the vegitation status is green there is a high probability there will be a locust attack in that area.</br>
